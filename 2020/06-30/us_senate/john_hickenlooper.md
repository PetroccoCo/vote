# John Hickenlooper

- 👎 sued Longmont after they banned fracking[1]

- 👎 found guilty of ethics violations and then blew off the subpeona to testify only to be held in conpempt[2].

- 👎 mocked bernie sanders in a televised debate[3]. (Don't vote for bullies. That's a Trump move.)

- 👎 has built his entire career and brand around being a moderate. I don't think right now is the time to be voting for moderates.

- 👎 I didn't like his campaign book, *Opposite of Woe*

- 👍 endorsed by stacy abrams, amy klobuchar, and gabby giffords[4]
