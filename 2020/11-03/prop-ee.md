# [2020-11-03](README.md) / Proposition EE: Taxes on Nicotine Products

Increases taxes on e-cigarettes and tobacco, funding education and housing.

## Vote

ðŸ‘Ž No

## Why

While I think tobacco products should be heavily taxes to align with their detriment on society, this is going to be a pretty regressive tax.
Additionally, the minimum pricing scheme in this law is also highly suspect. Likely this will create a monopoly in the tobacco industry which isn't great.
I would like to see e-cigs taxed but this is poorly written and going to have adverse impacts.
