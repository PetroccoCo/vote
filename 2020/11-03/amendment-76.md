# [2020-11-03](README.md) / Amendment 76: Citizen Qualification of Voters

Change the constitution from "EVERY CITIZEN" to "ONLY A CITIZEN":

> "Every citizen of the United States who has attained the age of eighteen years, has resided in this state for such a time as may be prescribed by law, and has been duly registered as a voter if required by law shall be qualified to vote at all elections."

## Vote

ðŸ‘Ž NO

## Why

This amendment is patently anti-democracy.

Plus the main consequence seems to be preventing 17 year olds (who will be 18 by the primary elections) from voting in the primaries. I don't see anything that says this will do what the proponents say it will do, which is preventing non-citizens from voting. (Which is already illegal.)
