# [2020-11-03](README.md) / Proposition 116: State Income Tax Rate Reduction

decrease the state income tax rate for individuals, estates, and trusts from 4.63% of federal taxable income to 4.55% for tax years commencing on and after January 1, 2020. The tax rate would also reduce the tax rate for domestic and foreign C corporations operating in Colorado from 4.63% of Colorado net income to 4.55%

## Vote

ðŸ‘Ž No

## Why

It will save taxpayers on average $37 per year in taxes, and will reduce the general fund by $203 million in 2020â€‘21 and $154 million in state budget year 2021â€‘22.

The cut favors the already wealthy and has little help / impact for the average wage earner.

Our state budgets have already been cut by 3 billion, and we can't afford to let our education and housing budgets lose another 300 million over the next two years.
