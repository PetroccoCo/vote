# [2020-11-03](README.md) / Proposition 117: Voter Approval for Certain New State Enterprises

require statewide voter approval of new state enterprises if the enterprise's projected or actual revenue from fees and surcharges is greater than $100 million within its first five years. #TABOR

Enterprises are defined by TABOR as government agencies that provide services for a fee (as opposed to be being funded by tax dollars). Examples include state lottery, state nursing homes, state correctional facilities, and the Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise.
