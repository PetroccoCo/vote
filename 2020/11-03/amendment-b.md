repeal the Gallagher Amendment of 1982, which limits the residential and non-residential property tax assessment rates so that residential property taxes equal 45% of the total share of state property taxes and non-residential property taxes equal 55% of the total share of state property taxes

this will raise property taxes, benefiting local government.

## Vote

üëç Yes

## Why

The legislature can reduce rates in the future.

And *voters* can raise rates in the future.

In the meantime, vital services get some reliable funding.
