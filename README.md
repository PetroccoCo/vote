# Vote

This is a description of how I plan to vote, and why (see
[values](values/README.md)).

If you'd like to change my mind on anything, feel free to open an issue or a
pull request. You're also welcome to fork this repo to plan your own votes.

This repo is inspired by, and is a fork of, @sreynen's [repo of the same name](https://github.com/sreynen/vote).

## Upcoming elections
