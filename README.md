# Vote

This is a description of how I plan to vote, and [why](values/README.md).

## Goals

1. Analyize and think more carefully about my options (because writing is thinking).

2. Open source my decision making process through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

3. Document my decisions for my own use, so I can reflect back on them.

## Contributing

If you'd like to change my mind on anything, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. You're also welcome to fork this repo to plan your own votes.

## Inspiration

This repo is inspired by, and is a fork of, [sreynen/vote](https://github.com/sreynen/vote).

It is also a sort of spiritual successor to [busterbenson/public](https://github.com/busterbenson/public).
