# Vote

This is a description of how I plan to vote, and [why](values/README.md).

## Goals

These are my goals:

1. **Articulation**: Analyize and think more carefully about my options. Because writing is thinking.

2. **Collaboration**: Open source my decision making process through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

3. **Documentation**: Document my decisions for my own use, so I can reflect back on them, and see where my beliefs have changed over time and for what reason.

## Motivation

I remember moving to Alabama in the first grade and being asked if I was for Auburn or Alabama. I had no idea what the question was even about. I It was the first question I was asked by another kid after "What's your name?" and I didn't even really know what football was. All I knew at the time was that I had moved to a place called Alabama, so it was maybe a safe choice to choose something named after that. (This idiotic five-year-old decision had profound consequences such as which friends I made, who my first girlfriend was, and ultimately where I went to college.)

Later, my political alignment was similar. I didn't understand the choice, nor my options. So I went with what seemed to be the safe choice at the time. It was a borrowed team affiliation that I didn't really care about, and which I believed didn't really matter or effect anything. (I didn't know then about the profound consequences of choice.)

Politics was a taboo subject when I was young. My family didn't talk about politics or voting ever. I didn't know the difference between a democrat and a republican until after I graduated high school. This is a partial condemnation of my upbringing, and a complete condemnation of my public education.

The first time I can actually remember engaging with politics was in the fourth grade, which is when the '92 presidential election happened. I remember being asked if I was for Bush or Clinton. This time I understood what the question was *about*. I knew what the president is. But I was just as mystified about my options. I didn't know what the difference was between a democrat and a republican.

Most of my classmates had the borrowed confidence of their parents' opinions, much like when it comes to which college football team to support. But I didn't have that.
