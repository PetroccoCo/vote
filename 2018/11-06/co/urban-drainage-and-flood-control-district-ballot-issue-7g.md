# [2018-11-06 Election](../README.md), Urban Drainage and Flood Control District Ballot Issue 7G

# Vote: Yes.

## Why:

* This sets tax rates back to what they were pre-TABOR, which seems like a reasonable budget.
* The opposition to this seems to be little more than general anti-tax sentiment, which I disagree with.
