# Vote: Jared Polis

## Why:

* Neither Helker's nor Hammon's website has enough information for me to understand their platforms.
* Stapleton is against universal healthcare and his education focus is charter schools.
* Polis is for universal healthcare and universal preschool.
* I believe both healthcare and school work best as public government services.
