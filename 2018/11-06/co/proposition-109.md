# [2018-11-06 Election](../README.md), State of Colorado Proposition 109

## Information:

* https://www.ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Proposition_109,_%22Fix_Our_Damn_Roads%22_Transportation_Bond_Initiative_(2018)

# Vote: No

## Why:

* This would spend more money on roads. I think we should invest more of our transportation spending on public transportation, less on roads.
* This is funded by a bond, that would eventually need to be paid back. Without increasing taxes, paying that back would take money away from other important items like health care and education.
