# Vote: Jena Griswold

## Why:

* Neither Amanda Campbell nor Blake Huber seem to have websites. In 2018, not having a website suggests not really wanting the office.
* Williams' campaign is focused on how good Colorado's election system is, which is true, but it could still be much better.
* Griswold's campaign is focused on what could be improved, and wants to increase voter participation.
* Griswold is also actively opposed to Trump's and Kris Koabach's voter supression efforts, which seems important.
