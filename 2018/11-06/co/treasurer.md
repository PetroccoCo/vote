# [2018-11-06 Election](../README.md), Colorado Treasurer

## Candidates:

* Brian Watson
* Dave Young
* Gerald F. Kilpatrick

# Vote: Dave Young

## Why:

* Gerald F. Kilpatrick doesn't seem to have a website. In 2018, not having a website suggests not really wanting the office.
* The main issue seems to be PERA. Brian Watson has a clearer plan for what to do with PERA, but that plan is focused on saving money for taxpayers, not on helping teachers. I expect Watson will end up cutting benefits for state employees if he gets the opportunity.
