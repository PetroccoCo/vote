# Vote: Phil Weiser

## Why:

* Robinson is focused on maintaining TABOR, which I don't support.
* On a wide variety of issues, I prefer Weiser's position to Brauchler's.
* One specific example, on opiods, Weiser supports lawsuits against manufacturers and decriminalizin usage, while Brauchler holds the opposite positions. That seems like a clear people vs. profit distinction.
