# Vote: Peter Smith

## Why:

* Calonder is against raising the minimum wage and for TABOR, both positions I disagree with.
* Rodriguez doesn't have any positions I disagree with, but also desn't take any positions that seem very controversial.
* Smith takes some more controversial positions I agree with, such as making Colorado a sanctuary state and repealing TABOR. I don't expect he'd be able to get very far with any of his positions, but I'd like to have his positions at least in the discussion.
