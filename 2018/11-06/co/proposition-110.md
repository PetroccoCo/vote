# [2018-11-06 Election](../README.md), State of Colorado Proposition 110

## Information:

* https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Proposition_110,_%22Let%27s_Go_Colorado%22_Transportation_Bond_and_Sales_Tax_Increase_Initiative_(2018)

# Vote: No

## Why:

* Most of the money for this (85%) would go to roads. I'd like more funding for public transportation instead. The 15% allocated to reducing vehicle use isn't directly allocated, requires local matching funds, while the road funding does not.
