# [2018-11-06 Election](../README.md), State of Colorado Amendment 75

## Information:

* https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Amendment_75,_Campaign_Contribution_Limits_Initiative_(2018)

# Vote: No

## Why:

* I'm in favor of making if more difficult for wealthy candidates to fund their own campaigns, but this seems like the wrong way to do it.
* This would allow political campaigns to raise more money from fewer people, making elected officials even less accountable.
