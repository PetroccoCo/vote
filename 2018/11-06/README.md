* https://www.billisrunning.com/
* http://www.willmon2018gov.com/

Vote: Jared Polis

Why:

* https://www.facebook.com/vmbellamy/ says "While I'm not running for governor anymore" so I gather Bellamy is no longer running.
* I couldn't find any information about the campaign of George Allen Cantrell, Richard Osada, Korey Paul Starkey, Michael Wilbourn, Matthew Wood, nor Kathleen Cunningham.
* Neither Helker's nor Hammon's website has enough information for me to understand their platforms.
* Willmon's website has plenty of issue positions, but they're all pretty vague.
* Stapleton is against universal healthcare and his education focus is charter schools.
* Polis is for universal healthcare and universal preschool.
* I believe both healthcare and school work best as public government services.
