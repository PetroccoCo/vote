# 2018-11-06 Election, U.S. House of Representatives, Colorado District 1

## Candidates:

* Diane Degette
* Casper Stockham
* Paul Daly

## Information:

* https://degette.com/
* http://www.casperforcolorado.com/
* http://pauldaly.us/

# Vote: Diane Degette

## Why:

* Casper wants to "seek out free market solutions" for health care. I believe we've tried that already and it isn't working.
* I can't tell from Daly's website what he supports.
* I don't find Degette particularly exciting, also don't find her particularly disagreeable.
