The following are some values that inform my voting. As with everything in this repository, pull requests or issues attempting to change my mind are welcome.

- democracy
    - end gerymandering
    - ranked choice voting
- legalize and tax drugs
- reduce climate change
- universal health care
- reduce the military

- tax equity
- education
- police
    - defund, disarm, and demilitarize the police
    - get rid of qualified immunity
    - get rid of civil asset forfeiture
    - independent oversight
- housing
    - the more housing the better
    - density and diversity builds better neighborhoods
    - density fights climate change better than virtually anything else
    - single family zoning, growth limiting, and other laws are somewhat racist in their impact
        - the government telling you what to do with your property is inherently problematic
    - free car storage incentivise more cars
- transit
    - buses, trains, bikes, scooters are climate change fighters. Also they are quiet, fun, and generally don't kill people.
