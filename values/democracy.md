# Democracy

It's easy to become disenchanted with democracy when someone you don't care for is elected. As Winston Churchill [once said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/267224-democracy-is-the-worst-form-of-government-except-for-all) (apparently quoting someone else without attribution):

> Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.

The reason democracy is the least-worst form of government is, in short, it's more sustainable than the alternatives, which generally involve violent revolution and suppression of dissent.
