> Colorado Proposition CC, Retain Revenue for Transportation and Education TABOR Measure (2019)
 
## Text

Without raising taxes and to better fund public schools, higher education, and roads, bridges, and transit, within a balanced budget, may the state keep and spend all the revenue it annually collects after June 30, 2019, but is not currently allowed to keep and spend under Colorado law, with an annual independent audit to show how the retained revenues are spent?

## Why

- I generally vote to raise taxes for more services

- I have worked for the city (and other agencies) and have experienced "spend it or lose it" budgeting, and it sucks. You can't project or plan ahead.
