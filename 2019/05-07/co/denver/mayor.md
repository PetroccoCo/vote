# Vote: Lisa Calder贸n

## Why:

I selected four issues that I currently care about in Denver, and evaluated each candidates on those issues. Results are below. Lisa Calder贸n came out the best. Some notes: Michael Hancock doesn't appear to have a platform for future goals. Seems like he's just running on his past accomplishments, which helped created the issues in my list. Kalyn Rose Heffernan is, I suspect, much more aligned with my views, but isn't specific enough about anything. And Marcus Giavanni seems oddly more concerned about what Google thinks than what voters think.
