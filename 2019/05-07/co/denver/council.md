# Vote: Deborah Ortega and Robin Kniech

## Why:

* I'm not really clear on what Langdon's nor Hayes' platform is.
* I like Parris' position on affordable housing, but I can't find much else from him.
* Both incumbents, Ortega and Kniech, voted against the camping ban. I don't like the camping ban.
* Ortega also voted against I70 highway expansion. I don't like the highway expansion.
* Kniech led the city's minimum wage increase.
* I generally like Pigford's platform, but it doesn't seem significantly different from Kniech's or Ortega's.
* I don't see a strong reason to vote out either of the incumbents.
