# Vote: Tony Pigford and Robin Kniech

## Why:

* I'm not really clear on what Langdon's nor Hayes' platform is.
* I like Parris' position on affordable housing, but I can't find much else from him.
* Both incumbents, Ortega and Kniech, voted against the camping ban. I don't like the camping ban because it turns homelessness into a crime, and I don't believe criminalization is a good way to deal with homelessness.
* Both incumbents are also against 300. They don't like that it goes beyond repealing the camping ban.
* Pigford supports Initiative 300, and seems more interested in the impact on homeless people than potential misuse do to unclear language, as am I.
* Kniech led the city's minimum wage increase.
* Ortega voted against I70 highway expansion. I don't like the highway expansion.
* I don't see a huge policy difference between Kniech and Ortega, but Kniech seems a little more focused on lower-income residents.
