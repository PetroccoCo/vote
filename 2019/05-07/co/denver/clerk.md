# Vote: Paul D. L贸pez

## Why:

* Sarah O. McCarthy doesn't appear to have a platform, is just running on experience.
* Both Peg Perl and Paul D. L贸pez seem to generally agree with my views.
* Paul D. L贸pez has more detail about his platform and appears to have more awareness of what kinds of issues might come up in the job. For example, he mentions marriage equality and the Trump administration's attempts to get local voter information.
