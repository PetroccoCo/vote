# June 7, 2019

I will be voting in Denver, Colorado for this election. This is a runoff of the [May 7, 2019 election](../05-07/README.md).

For Mayor, my previous choice, Lisa Calderón, endorsed Jamie Giellis and that's the main basis for my decision. Giellis has made a lot of mistakes, but still seems a little better than Hancock.
