# [2019-06-07 Election](../../README.md), Initiated Ordinance 302

## Text

Shall the voters of the City and County of Denver enact a measure prohibiting the use of public monies, resources, or fiscal guarantees in connection with any future Olympic Games, without the City first obtaining voter approval at a regularly scheduled municipal election or special election should the City decide to use public monies, resources, or guarantees for this purpose?

# Vote: Yes

## Why:

This ordinance seems likely to prevent Denver from ever hosting the Olympics. The Olympics generally has a negative impact on the host city, so I'm in favor of making it more difficult for that to happen here.
